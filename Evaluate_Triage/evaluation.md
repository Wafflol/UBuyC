### Evaluation of project-mithrellas-planify

Testing Method:
We began by following Planify's installation guide. Next, we performed a general test of the app’s user interface and functionalities. This involved interacting with the calendar, opening different menus, and testing functions such as adding new courses and generating bus directions to/from UBC.  Lastly, we compared the app’s functionality to the specifications listed in the Requirements.md and Specifications.md files. 

Discovered Bugs:

* Hard to test address setting, as it appears as a random popup on app install
* No way to change address after setting
* Address setting button is just a blank blue square
* Adding 5+ courses makes calendar unviewable
* Unable to edit courses
* Can create a course with end time < start time
* Allowed to add non-existent location address when creating account
* Generates bus information for a non-existent address
