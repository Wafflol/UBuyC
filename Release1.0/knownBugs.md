1. Haven't replicated yet, but there's a way to get an extra otp to get sent to email (doesn't affect security) if already authenticated
2. If a user is already authenticated and logged in, they are able to go to other users' account page if the userid and email is known through the url
3. Can access login and signup after login
4. Can't delete listings yet
5. Database and email login are hardcoded in the repo because if the website doesn't work, you have to run the website locally using the bash/batch scripts, so you need the login info
6. Theres's not many error messages during signup/login (oops!)
