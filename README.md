## Mission Statement
To facilitate a trustworthy student marketplace.

## Problem
Second-hand marketplaces, while extremely useful and convenient, can also be very risky to use. Many online marketplaces suffer from shady transactions, and fraudulent activity is hard to prevent. For example, Facebook Marketplace is a popular website where large numbers of transactions take place each day. However, scamming is easy on Facebook Marketplace. In a 2022 survey of 1000 people in the US, 62% reported encountering a scam on the marketplace. Sellers may sell defective equipment, they might request advance payments and then not show up, and the worst part? They can just create a new account once they get caught.
